        <h1 class='center'> Energy Conservation Through AI </h1>

        <p class='box-shadow'>
            Insights that are synthesised are the result of intellectual activity, including study, analysis, logic, and
            observation. Tasks, including robotics, control mechanisms, computer vision, scheduling, and data mining,
            fall under the umbrella of artificial intelligence.

            <br><br> The term 'artificial intelligence' may be used for any computer that has characteristics similar to the
            human brain, including the ability to think critically, make decisions, and increase productivity. The
            foundation of AI is human insights that may be determined in such a manner that machines can easily realise
            jobs, from the most simple to the most complicated.

        <h1 class='center'>How Can We Conserve Energy With AI?</h1>

        <p class='box-shadow'>
            By applying AI to data pertaining to the energy collected, the industry can gather granular
            consumption insights that it can use to introduce new services. It can also locate upstream and downstream
            products operating in dynamic pricing models.

            <br> Around 70% of all generated electricity powers factories and buildings, with 60% of that being
            wasted. That represents billions of dollars spent on generating energy that we have not consumed. To stop this from happening, we first have to understand where and how the waste is happening. This is where artificial intelligence comes in.

            <br><br> Artificial Intelligence integrates AI applications into energy efficiency strategies for
            municipalities, industrial clients, and commercial clients to help them with energy forecasting, energy
            management, renewable energy storage, and sustainable development into the future.

            <br> Artificial intelligence monitors, collects information, controls, evaluates, and manages energy
            consumption in buildings and factories.

            <br> It controls energy usage and reduces it during peak hours, identifies and signals problems, and
            detects equipment failures before they occur.
