        <h1> Energy Conservation Through AI </h1>

        <p>
            <h3>What Is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
            <li> The term artificial intelligence may be used for any computer that has characteristics
                similar to thehuman brain,including the ability to think critically, make decisions, and
                increase productivity. The foundation of AI ishuman insights that may be determined in such
                a manner that machines can easily realize the jobs, from themost simple to the most
                complicated. </li>
            <li>Insights that are synthesized are the result of intellectual activity, including study,
                analysis, logic,and observation. Tasks, including robotics, control mechanisms, computer
                vision, scheduling, and data mining,fall under the umbrella of artificial intelligence.</li>
            <p>
            <h3>What Is Human Intelligence?</h3>
            <li>The origins of human intelligence and conduct may be traced back to the individual's unique
                combination of genetics,upbringing, and exposure to various situations and environments. And
                it hinges entirely on one's freedom to shape hisor her environment via the application of
                newly acquired information.</li>
            <li>The information it provides is varied. For example, it may provide information on a person
                with a similar skill set orbackground, or it may reveal diplomatic information that a
                locator or spy was tasked with obtaining.After everythingis said and done, it is able to
                deliver information about interpersonal relationships and the arrangement ofinterests.</li>
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                <li>While managing intermittency of renewable energy is the biggest goal, AI can
                    also help the industry improve safety,reliability and efficiency. It can also
                    provide visibility into energy leakage, consumption patterns and equipment
                    health. For instance,predictive analytics can take sensor data from a wind
                    turbine to monitor wear and tear, and predict with a high degree of accuracy
                    whent would need maintenance.</li>
                <li>Artificial Intelligence technologies can also help renewable energy suppliers
                    launch new service models and expand the market placefor higher participation.
                    By applying AI to data pertaining to the energy collected, the industry can
                    gather granular consumption insightsthat it can use to introduce new service,
                    the industry can also locate upstream/ downstream products operating in dynamic
                    pricingmodels.</li>
            </p>
            Around 70% of all generated electricity powers factories and buildings with 60% of that is
                wasted.<br>That representsbillions of dollars spent on generated energy that we have not
                consumed. To stop this from happening, we first haveto understand where and how the wastage
                is happening.
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>This is where artificial intelligence comes in. Artificial Intelligence integrates AI
                    applications into Energyefficiency strategies for municipalities, industrial and
                    commercial clients to help them with energy forecasting,energy management, renewable
                    energy storage, and sustainable development into the future.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Artificial intelligence monitors, collects information, controls, evaluates and manages
                    energy consumption inbuildings and factories. It controls energy usage and reduces it
                    during peak hours, identifies and signals problems,and detects equipment failures before
                    they occur. It has the ability to compress and analyze large sets o fdata thacan help
                    monitor and interpret the data produced by energy industries to optimize energy
                    consumption.Depending onthe company or industry the bottlenecks are at different stages
                    of their processes. By using data to drive decisionmaking, AI can actively monitor such
                    processes and, using predictive analysis, bring to attention the problem issues
                    beforethey occur. AI solutions are capable of accepting numbers, text, images and videos
                    to make such predictions.This enables wide applicability of AI but also requires a
                    trained problem solver to tailor each AI solutionto address each problem.</li>
