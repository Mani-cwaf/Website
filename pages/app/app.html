            The sustainable city, eco-city, or green city is a city designed with consideration for social, economic,
            environmental impact (commonly referred to as the triple bottom line), and resilient habitat for existing
            populations, without compromising the ability of future generations to experience the same. The UN
            Sustainable Development Goal 11 defines sustainable cities as those that are dedicated to achieving green
            sustainability, social sustainability and economic sustainability. They are committed to doing so by
            enabling opportunities for all through a design focused on inclusivity as well as maintaining a sustainable
            economic growth. The focus also includes minimizing required inputs of energy, water, and food, and
            drastically reducing waste, output of heat, air pollution â€“ CO2, methane, and water pollution. Richard
            Register first coined the term ecocity in his 1987 book Ecocity Berkeley: Building Cities for a Healthy
            Future, where he offers innovative city planning solutions that would work anywhere. Other leading figures
            who envisioned sustainable cities are architect Paul F Downton, who later founded the company Ecopolis Pty
            Ltd, as well as authors Timothy Beatley and Steffen Lehmann, who have written extensively on the subject.
            The field of industrial ecology is sometimes used in planning these cities.
