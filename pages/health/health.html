    <h1 class="center">1. Accurate Cancer Diagnosis</h1>
    <p>PathAI offers one of the best Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence tools in healthcare that
        allows
        Pathologists to make accurate diagnoses.
        <br>PathAI reduces errors during the process of cancer diagnosis and offers a range of new techniques
        for
        individual medical treatment.
        <br>With increased accuracy in the diagnosis of cancer patients, most of them can be looked after or be
        cured at
        a stage where it does not turn fatal, saving numerous lives.
    </p>
    <h1 class="center">2. Early Diagnosis of Fatal Blood Diseases</h1>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence proves to be of immense help when it comes to diagnosing possibly fatal
        blood-related
        diseases at an early stage.
        <br>With the help of AI-enhanced microscopes, doctors are now able to scan for harmful substances and
        bacteria
        in samples of blood, such as Staphylococcus, E. coli, etc., at a much faster rate compared to the speed
        in
        manual scanning.
        <br>Scientists used over 25,000 blood sample images so that the machines could learn how they should
        find the
        harmful bacteria.
        <br>AI allowed the machines to learn to identify these bacteria in the blood and predict their presence
        in the
        new samples with an accuracy of 95 percent, reducing fatality by a large margin.
    </p>
    <h1 class="center">3. Customer Service Chatbots</h1>
    <p> Chatbots are developed using technologies like NLP, allowing patients to raise their queries regarding
        appointments, bill payments, and more.
        <br>Chatbots also communicate with the patients with respect to their illness and symptoms, which in
        turn helps
        in reducing the load on medical professionals.
    </p>
    <h1 class="center">4. Virtual Health Assistants</h1>
    <p>Virtual health assistants are responsible for a number of things, including responding to the queries of
        routine
        patients via calls and emails, managing medical information of the patients and covering sensitive data,
        scheduling appointments with doctors, sending follow-ups and clinical appointment reminders to the
        patients,
        etc.</p>
    <h1 class="center">5. Treatment of Rare Diseases</h1>
    <p> BERG is an AI-based clinical-stage biotech platform that works on mapping diseases to speed up the
        finding and
        creation of advanced breakthrough medicines and vaccines, changing the approach to healthcare.
        <br>It uses research and development (R&D), along with interrogative biology, that allows medical
        professionals
        to create robust products for patients fighting rare diseases.
