        <h1>What is AI?</h1>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring
            information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans.
            Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between
            (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs. AI applications include advanced web search
            engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding
            human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), automated decision-making and
            competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go). As machines become
            increasingly capable, tasks consclassered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of
            AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded
            from things consclassered to be AI,</p>
